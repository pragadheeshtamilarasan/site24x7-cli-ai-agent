2. **Detect Changes** in API endpoints, parameters, or documentation
3. **Generate Updated CLI Code** using AI analysis
4. **Push Changes** to your `site24x7-cli` repository
5. **Create Release** with version bump and changelog

### Real-time (via Webhooks)
1. **Monitor Issues** - Respond to new issues automatically
2. **Handle Pull Requests** - Review and provide feedback
3. **Process Comments** - Respond to mentions and questions
4. **Track Releases** - Monitor new versions and usage

- **Complex PRs** need human review
- **API Breaking Changes** require architectural decisions
- **Build Failures** occur after automatic updates

## Testing the Setup

### 1. Test Application Health
```bash
curl https://your-agent-url.com/health
# Should return: {"status": "healthy", ...}
```

### 2. Test Webhook Endpoint
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-agent-url.com/webhooks/github \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Event: ping" \
  -d '{"zen": "Test webhook"}'
# Should return: {"message": "pong"}
```

### 3. Test GitHub Integration
1. Create a test issue in your `site24x7-cli` repository
2. Check agent logs at `https://your-agent-url.com/logs`
3. Verify the issue appears in agent dashboard

### 4. Test API Scraping (Manual)
1. Go to `https://your-agent-url.com/dashboard`
2. Click "Trigger Scrape" (if available)
3. Monitor logs for scraping activity

## Dashboard Access

Once deployed, access your agent at:
- **Dashboard:** `https://your-agent-url.com/dashboard`
- **Logs:** `https://your-agent-url.com/logs`
- **Configuration:** `https://your-agent-url.com/config`
- **API Status:** `https://your-agent-url.com/api/v1/status`

## Security Best Practices

1. **Rotate Tokens Quarterly** - Update GitHub and OpenAI tokens regularly
2. **Use Strong Webhook Secret** - Generate a random 32+ character secret
3. **Monitor Access Logs** - Check who's accessing your agent
4. **Review Generated Code** - Always review AI-generated changes before merging
5. **Set Up Branch Protection** - Require PR reviews for main branch

## Support and Monitoring

### Health Monitoring
- The agent includes built-in health checks
- Monitor at `/health` endpoint
- Dashboard shows system status

### Troubleshooting
- Check logs at `/logs` endpoint
- Review webhook delivery in GitHub repository settings
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Test API connectivity with curl commands

### Common Issues
1. **Webhook not receiving events** - Check GitHub webhook settings and URL
2. **GitHub operations failing** - Verify token permissions and expiration
3. **API scraping issues** - Check Site24x7 website accessibility
4. **AI features disabled** - Verify OpenAI API key is set and valid

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Deploy the agent to your preferred platform
2. ✅ Set up the required environment variables
3. ✅ Configure GitHub webhook in your repository
4. ✅ Test the webhook delivery
5. ✅ Monitor the first automated scraping cycle
6. ✅ Review and approve the first AI-generated CLI update

The agent is now ready to automatically maintain your Site24x7 CLI tool!
