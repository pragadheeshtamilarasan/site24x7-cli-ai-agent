🔍 Diagnostic Information:
- Container Status: restarting
- Internal Access: no
- Port Binding: 

📋 Troubleshooting Steps:
1. Check container logs: docker-compose -f docker-compose.minimal.yml logs
2. Restart container: docker-compose -f docker-compose.minimal.yml restart
3. Try different port: Edit docker-compose.minimal.yml to use port 8080
4. Check firewall: sudo ufw status
